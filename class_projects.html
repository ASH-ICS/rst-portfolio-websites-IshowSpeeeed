Week 5
GTA 6 is one of the most highly unticipated games of all time, with gamers from all over the world waiting for its release for a long time. The game was announced to be being worked on in February 4, 2022 via twitter, but since then, no additional information has been shared with the public, and the release date for the game is still unknown.. Last year a nuch of GTA 6 footage has been leaked all over the internet forcing Rock star to take action and remove all early development footage from the internet. The leaks contained the GTA 6 pre alpha state and showed some of the brand new characters and locations, but other data is still unknown. . In an article by Bloomberg, published in June 2022 a former Rock start employe estimated that the release was estimated to happen in about 2 years, but this is unconfirmed as there could be potential draw backs. GTA 6 is expected to run primarily on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as they have ran in the past. Last september, what was described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry happened to GTA 6. A user by the name of teapotubehacker leaked about 90 videos in the official GTA forum, which contained early in development gameplay footage. After the post blew up, the hacker tried to set up a deal with Rockstar and Take-Two to take down the videos he posted. The videos were deleted by the original user who posted them, but can still be found throoughout the internet. Rockstar hasn’t confirmed where the GTA 6 story line will take place but there’s a lot of rumors, gossips and predictions floating around. It seems as if the GTA 6 setting will take place in Vice City (Rockstar’s virtual version of Miami), that's backed up by the leaked gameplay footage, one of which showed a “Vice City Metro” train. According to an ex-worker of Rockstar Games, at the start of the development, there were areas in the game modeled after both South and North America, but apparently it was cut back so that the devs could focus on Vice City’s surrounding areas, though "the game’s world remains large, with more interior locations than previous Grand Theft Auto games". But the map wont remain static. According to the report, the map wont remain static, as the developers aim to make regular updates to missions, locations and the map. The idea of this is to take off pressure from the developers during the developing phase and to transfer it to the active game phase. This promises to shorten the wait for the game and keep it interesting after it is released. To conclude, we do not know exactly when the game will be released, but we can expect it to be around 2 years of wait. The in game location will be Miami, or “Vice CIty”, and the game will have way more interior locations than the previous version. Missions, Objectives and locations will be continuously updated as the game is released. Lastly, the storyline is gonna be completely knew and promises to make the game very interesting.

Week 6
Rugby is a sport that contains a lot of physical contact, and since players don't wear any protective gear, they always feel the full force of the hit, which can be especially dangerous with head concussions. One of the only protective gear used is the mouthguard, which protects them from tooth damage and mouth lacerations and makes them look cool. Recently, after observing positive results in hockey, the Rugby union “World Rugby” said that they will start to introduce smart technology mouthguards to Rugby. The mouthguards will be able to measure head impacts and acceleration of a player. The data from the mouthguards will be sent to the pitch side doctors allowing them to see the impact of the hit and decide if the player should stay on or be taken off. World Rugby is making an investment of 2 million euros toward the support of rugby unions, clubs and competition for an adoption for the new mouthguard technologie. Dr Eanna Falvey, the chief medical officer of World Rugby stated: “The latest scientific research and expert opinion is telling us one thing — reduce the forces players experience on their heads at all levels of the game. That is exactly what we’re doing.” She added: “The advances in smart mouthguard technology mean elite players will be better cared for than ever before. We are taking smart mouthguards out of the realm of medical research and putting them into the world of everyday performance management to continue to manage player welfare in the best way possible.”

Week 7 
What is Blockchain? Blockchain is a ledge that works almost as a full history of transactions for Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Each new transaction that happens with the Cryptocurrency is recorded in a block, where the information gets encrypted. Each new block attaches to the last one, making a chain of blocks, hence the name Blockchain. The purpose of blockchain: Blockchain allows for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to not be regulated by a central authority, but instead to have the transactions in the currency verified by all the users, who can see all the transactions live at blockchain.com. Each computer that is connected to the the blockchain network receives a copy of the blockchain upon connecting to it. This ensures that a single individual can’t change any info on the chain, since all the blockchain copies wont allow for changes to be made. Blockchain in other industries: Currently more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, but thats not all. Recently, food companies have started to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations. This can help with the prevention of food transmitted diseases like eColi. How does a Blockchain work? A blockchain is like a spreadsheet but not the exactly same. Spread sheets and block sheets used by the Block Chain are accessed and structured in different ways.

Week 8
Apple is currently making a big effort to respond to the fast rise of artificial intelligence in the tech industry. The company, historically somewhat passive in this area, found itself left behind as OpenAI's ChatGPT gained fame. Google and Microsoft, in the meantime, launched AI powered search engines capable of generating human-like responses, while Microsoft enhanced its Windows applications with more intelligent virtual assistants. Meanwhile, all Apple's did was create an improved spell-check system in iOS 17. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges that the company has been engaged in AI development for an extended period. However, Apple's executives were evidently taken by surprise when AI suddenly gained so much momentum, leading to an effort to make up for lost time since late last year. This has created a lot of anxiety in the company and a recognition of having fallen short in the area.. To cover the AI technology gap, Apple has taken a multifaceted approach. High-level executives, John Giannandrea and Craig Federighi, are at the front of the effort, allocating a budget of approximately $1 billion annually to this initiative. Giannandrea is focused on developing the underlying technology for a new AI system and remaking Siri to make it more sophisticated. Federighi's software engineering group is incorporating AI into the next version of iOS. In addition, Apple is exploring the integration of generative AI into development tools and various apps, including Apple Music and productivity apps. The company is also thinking about deployment options for generative AI, whether it should be on-device, cloud-based, or a hybrid approach. The significance of this change is that AI is promised to be in the center of computers in a not so distant future, and Apple does not want to be left behind.

Week 12
Recently, researchers have been conducting innovative research on a device known as a Solar Tower Power Plant, invented in 1981 by Spanish engineers. This device was not widely adopted because of the cost and how big the device was. Additionally this power plant has a limited energy production and only works during the daytime. Throughout the years there have been slight improvements to it, but nothing significant enough to popularize the model. However, researchers from Qatar and Jordan have achieved better results by implementing downdraft technology to the plant. The power plant can now generate electricity during the day and the night, as air from daytime sunlight retains heat, said the researchers. After testing the plant, it was estimated that the energy generated in one year was around the amout energy needed to power about 753 homes for nearly five weeks. TTSS, they say, consists of an updraft tower of about 652 ft height and a 45-foot diameter with 10 downdraft towers circling the updraft tower.
